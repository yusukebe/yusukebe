Hi! I'm Yusuke Wada, and you can find me under the account name "_yusukebe_" in almost any place - remember it. I work as a developer, creator, or supervisor. While I don't consider myself a _full-stack_ developer, it appears that's what I am.

> _I love "web"_.

Do you like the web?

I have grown up with the growth of "_web_". I've developed various mash-up services, user-generated content systems, web APIs for mobile apps, and practical CLI tools. Most are like junk, junk, junk... But a few have been utilized by people and have even changed some lives. I'll keep contributing to _web_.

> _Just for fun_.

Didn't you hear those words somewhere?

I want to be like that teenager who's just starting out with a guitar, eager to own one. He saves up, buys a new acoustic guitar, and then plays Led Zeppelin's "Tangerine" in a park on a mountain top until his hands ache. Just for fun.

## What I'm creating

You might say, "_What are you creating now?_". The answer is:

> _I'm making a framework everyday_.

I'm a creator of [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono).
And you can look up others on my GitHub repositories.
