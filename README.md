Hi! I'm Yusuke Wada. My account name is "*yusukebe*" in almost any place. Remember it. I'm a developer, creator, or supervisor. I don't believe that you call me *full-stack*, but it seems to be *full-stack*.

> *I love "web"*.

Do you like web?
I have grown up with the growth of "*web*". I've created many mush-up services, user-generated contents systems, web APIs for mobile applications, useful CLI tools, and so on. Most are like junk, junk, junk... But a few have been used by some people.
I'll keep contributing to *web*.

> *Just for fun*.

Didn't you hear those words somewhere?
I want to be a developer like a teenager who is a beginner of guitar, want to have his own guitar, save money, get a new acoustic guitar,  play Led Zeppelin's "Tangerine" in a park on the top of a mountain until his hands are broken.
Just for fun.

## What I'm creating

You say, "*What are you creating now?*". The answer is:

> *I'm making a framework everyday*.

I'm a creator of [Hono](https://github.com/honojs/hono). Then you can look up others on my GitHub repositories.
